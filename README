Requirements for Running GroundCOFE on Eclipse:
	Download eclipse indigo(currently the latest version) from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
	Download java jdk x86 version 1.7 from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk-7u3-download-1501626.html
	-Note must be the x86 version, because this program uses 32 bit libraries, must be 1.7 because this program uses 1.7 switch features

Todo:	
	calibration
	test min/max angles
	different move types in joystick section
	degrees modulus 360
	steps & encoder steps for galil should be the same
	maximum degree move relative
	ra/dec tracking "change ra/dec" doesn't populate text areas

customize user interface for galil or ftdi?
slightly implemented 4/17 Reed.  made "encoder steps" radio button hidden if stageType is galil

	Renabled limits in stage-added printstatements to AllowedMove in ActGalil
	Added a dialog box that pops up when user tries to move outside limits inside main window, had to import JOptionpane

Jason 4/13
	Changed ui interface of gotopos
	removed superfulous code in AzElWindow 
Why is the 10 important in the velocity code
